# Predictive Apprehension

By Michael Feffer, Rui Li, and Aaron Vontell

With the rise of machine learning models and methods in this data-rich age, one can now attempt to prevent and predict crime through an analysis of previous crimes and patterns. In this project, we present our results in attempting to use neural networks, K-Nearest Neighbors, and generative models to predict and analyze crime, specifically in the City of Chicago. We conclude with a discussion of the next steps that one could take to further this work.

We are working with a crime dataset from Kaggle, which includes crime data from the City of Chicago during the years ranging from 2012 to 2017 (see paper for references)
